# Zotero Report Customizer

Does what [Jason Priem's "Report Cleaner"](http://jasonpriem.org/projects/report_cleaner.php), but
without the copy-paste-into-website bit. Configuration panel allows you to pick the elements to remove
from the report, and they will simple not show up. Settings are synced through Firefox Sync if you
have set it up.
